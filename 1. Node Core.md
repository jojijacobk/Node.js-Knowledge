# The global object
- Like `window` is the global object in browser environment, `global` is the global object of node.js environment. So, `console.log()` can be also written as `global.console.log()`.
- Each js file is a module. And, you have to export variables, functions, objects into global scope if you need to access it from another module or from global space.
- `process.argv`
- `process.stdin.on`
- `process.stdout.write`
